This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:
**Title:** _Learning Time-Varying Quantum Lossy Channels_  
**Authors:** Angela Rosy Morgillo*, Stefano Mancini, Massimiliano F. Sacchi and Chiara Macchiavello  

> Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties.  
> In this work, we study *Gaussian lossy channels* that vary from one use to another.  
> Neural networks are employed to **classify**, **regress**, and **forecast** these channels based on their Choi-Jamiolkowski states.

The models achieve:
- ðŸ“Š At least **87% accuracy** in classifying **memoryless**, **Markovian**, **non-Markovian**, **compound**, and **deterministic** channels.
- ðŸ“ˆ Precise reconstruction (regression) of the time-varying **loss parameter sequence**.
- ðŸ”® Accurate forecasting of future values, with performance improving as the **memory parameter approaches 1**.
