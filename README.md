> Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties.  
> In this work, we study *Gaussian lossy channels* that vary from one use to another.  
> Neural networks are employed to **classify**, **regress**, and **forecast** these channels based on their Choi-Jamiolkowski states.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `tvc.py`: Contains the core functions used throughout the project and imported by the other scripts.
- `classification.ipynb`: Code for generating datasets and training neural networks to classify quantum channel types (e.g., memoryless, Markovian, non-Markovian, compound, deterministic).
- `regression.ipynb`: Code for training neural networks to regress the transmissivity parameter sequence from time series of covariance matrix components associated with lossy Gaussian channels.
- `forecasting.ipynb`: Code for training neural networks to forecast future values of the transmissivity parameter sequence from time series of covariance matrix components associated with lossy Gaussian channels.
