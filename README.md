# Learning Time-Varying Quantum Lossy Channels

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:
**Title:** _Learning Time-Varying Quantum Lossy Channels_  
**Authors:** Angela Rosy Morgillo*, Stefano Mancini, Massimiliano F. Sacchi, Chiara Macchiavello  

> Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties.  
> In this work, we study *Gaussian lossy channels* that vary from one use to another.  
> Neural networks are employed to **classify**, **regress**, and **forecast** these channels based on their Choi-Jamiolkowski states.
